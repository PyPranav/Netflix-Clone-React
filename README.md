# NETFLIX_CLONE

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Fetches real-time data from TMDb API to display the latest movies, TV shows, and other media content.
- **User Interface**: Mimics Netflix's UI/UX for a familiar and intuitive user experience.
- **Categorized Content**: Movies and shows are sorted into categories like "Trending Now," "Top Rated," and "New Releases," among others.

## API

This project utilizes [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api" target="_blank">TMDb API</a>) to retrieve information on movies and TV shows.
